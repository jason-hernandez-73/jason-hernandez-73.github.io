	<title>The Biologist Who Codes</title>

<body>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My background is in biology. Like all scientists, biologists have to use statistics, and Excel is not always sufficient. I first got involved with coding 
in order to use R, SAS, and similar tools; but Python can do a lot of those functions, too. At present, my goal is to stay focused on science, and use my data 
analytics skills in that field.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is my GitHub page, but not my first website. That one can be found at <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/wa/vagabond/">The Vagabond's Camp</a>,
	which has been up since 1999. It started as a venue to try to counteract the Y2K hysteria; but when (surprise, surprise) nothing came of that, I expanded to
	other topics.</p>
