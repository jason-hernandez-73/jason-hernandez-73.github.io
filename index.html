<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My background is in biology. Like all scientists, biologists have to use statistics, and Excel is not always sufficient. I first got involved with coding in order to use R, SAS, and similar tools; but Python can do a lot of those functions, too. At present, my goal is to stay focused on science, and use my data analytics skills in that field.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is my GitHub page, but not my first website. That one can be found at <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/wa/vagabond/">The Vagabond's Camp</a>, which has been up since 1999. It started as a venue to try to counteract the Y2K hysteria; but when (surprise, surprise) nothing came of that, I expanded to other topics, including counteracting some of the Creationist foolishness that just doesn't die, and celebrating nature and travel. All these years, it has been in pure html. Now that I have been introduced to CSS and Bootstrap, I will be improving it visually.</p>
	
As a biologist, I consider my code a tool that I use in my main work. So, here is a list of my published papers:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://jco.birdscaribbean.org/index.php/jco/article/view/263/0">2016: Avian biodiversity in a pasture-dominated ecosystem.</li>
	<li><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19221.x.">2012: Synergistic effects of multiple mechanisms drive priority effects within a tadpole assemblage.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.aroid.org/aroideana/getarticle.php?key=MDMwMDAxMQ==P">2007: In Hawaiian rainforests: exotic aroid ecologies.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.aroid.org/aroideana/getarticle.php?key=MDI1MDAxMA==D">2002: Notes on the Araceae of Botel Tobago, Western Pacific</li>
	</ul>
I will be adding selected repos as I complete those projects.
